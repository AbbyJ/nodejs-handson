## Hello and Welcome

This is the base template for the Node.JS introductory hands-on session at the ASU GESSA meeting on 24th March 2017.

## Progress

As the session progresses, updated code would be pushed to the repository so that those of you who couldn't catch up can pull the latest code and continue learning.
